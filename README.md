Backup repo juuuust in case I break it over the weekend while trying to catch up

- learned a README file will display in the repo in plaintext. Potentially very useful or documenting/commenting code & catching up at a glance

- learned how to connect two git repos with unrelated histories from the terminal error “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories” from https://www.educative.io/answers/the-fatal-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-git-error

- learned the importance of backing up my workspace. Almost lost everything for Cider Falls :/

- still unable to get Where Is This Service done. Event listeners run, and window pops up on click, but both interpolated values are currently undefined. Bummer.
