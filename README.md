Backup repo juuuust in case I break it over the weekend while trying to catch up


9.25.22 
- learned a README file will display in the repo in plaintext. Potentially very useful or documenting/commenting code & catching up at a glance

- learned how to connect two git repos with unrelated histories from the terminal error “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories” from https://www.educative.io/answers/the-fatal-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-git-error

- learned the importance of backing up my workspace. Almost lost everything for Cider Falls :/
